# Blocking Direct Queries to the Database

This document outlines the process of blocking direct queries to the database, ensuring that all database interactions
are performed through the application layer.

## Overview

Blocking direct queries to the database is an important security measure to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data
integrity. By enforcing all database interactions through the application layer, you can control access to sensitive
data and maintain a secure environment.

## Implementation

### Use of Triggers

One approach to blocking direct queries is to use database triggers. Triggers can be used to intercept SQL commands
before they are executed and enforce restrictions based on predefined conditions.

#### Example Trigger

Here's an example of a trigger implemented in PostgreSQL to prevent direct updates to a specific table:

```sql
-- disable-direct-updates.sql

CREATE
OR REPLACE FUNCTION prevent_direct_update_user_details()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS
$$
BEGIN
    IF
NOT (current_setting('application_name') = 'YourAuthorizedAppName') THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Updates to user_details must be made through the authorized application.';
END IF;

RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER enforce_direct_update_user_details
    BEFORE UPDATE
    ON user_details
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_direct_update_user_details();

```

In this example, the trigger enforce_direct_update_user_details is created to intercept update operations on the
user_details table. It checks if the update operation is coming from the authorized application (YourAuthorizedAppName)
by comparing the current application name set in the database session. If the update is not authorized, an exception is
raised.

### Advantages

#### Enhanced Security:

By blocking direct queries, you can prevent unauthorized access and maintain data integrity.

#### Centralized Control:

All database interactions are controlled through the application layer, allowing for centralized management and
auditing.

#### Flexibility:

Triggers can be customized to enforce specific business rules and security policies tailored to your application
requirements.

## Conclusion

Blocking direct queries to the database is a critical security measure to protect sensitive data and ensure data
integrity. By implementing triggers and enforcing all database interactions through the application layer, you can
control access to your database and maintain a secure environment for your application.
